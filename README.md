# Coronavirus Tweet Sentiment Analysis

Tweets have been pulled from the Twitter and manual tagging has been done.The names and usernames has given codes to avoid any privacy concerns.

More information about this Project.

1. Problem Statement-
    To built a classification model to predict the sentiments of COVID-19 tweets.

2. Sources:
   (a) Date:    27th feb 2023. (Project Date)

3. Features:
    1.UserName : Coded Username

    2.ScreenName : Coded Screename

    3.location : Region of origin

    4.TweetAt : Tweet Timing

    5.OriginalTweet: first tweet in thread

    6.Sentiment-Target Variable : Sentiment of the tweet


4. Techniques and Algorithms used -
    Machine learning using python.In this project Implemented NLP Techniques Like Bow ,TF-IDF algorithm to extract features and top of it implmented ML Models like Logistic Regression,Linear SVM,XGboost to correctly classify the sentiments of the tweets. 

5. Conclusions-
    1. Among 3 Models,our best performing model is Linear SVM with test log loss 0.45.
    2. Precision for class 1 (Positive) is 81% and recall is 84.8%.
    3. Precision for class 0 (Negative) is 82.5% and recall is 78.2%.
    4. Performance can be furthur imporved by using deep learning models,however at cost of computational expense.
